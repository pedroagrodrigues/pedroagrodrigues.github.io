### Step 1: Check the Current Hostname

Before changing the hostname, check the current hostname of your system using the following command:

```bash
hostnamectl
```
{: .nolineno }

or

```bash 
hostname
```
{: .nolineno }



### Step 2: Change the Hostname Temporarily (Until Reboot)
If you want to change the hostname temporarily (it will revert after a reboot), use the following command:

```bash
sudo hostname new-hostname
```
{: .nolineno }

Replace new-hostname with your desired hostname.

To verify the change:

```bash
hostname
```
{: .nolineno }

### Step 3: Change the Hostname Permanently
To change the hostname permanently, follow these steps:

Edit the `/etc/hostname` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```
{: .nolineno }

Replace the existing hostname with your new hostname, then save and exit the file.


Open the `/etc/hosts` file, find the line that starts with `127.0.0.1` (or `127.0.1.1`) and replace the old hostname with the new one. 
For example:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
127.0.1.1 new-hostname
```
{: .nolineno }


Save and exit the file.

Apply the Changes

Use the `hostnamectl` command to apply the new hostname:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new-hostname
```
{: .nolineno }

### Step 4: Verify the Changes
To confirm that the hostname has changed, run the following:

```bash
hostnamectl
```
or

```bash 
hostname
```
{: .nolineno }

You should see the new hostname displayed.


### Step 5: Reboot the System (Optional)
To ensure the changes are fully applied, reboot your system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```
{: .nolineno }

After the reboot, verify the hostname again to confirm if the changes persisted.

> **Additional Notes:** Ensure the new hostname follows standard naming conventions (e.g., no spaces, special characters, or underscores). If your system is part of a network, ensure the new hostname does not conflict with other devices.

## Conclusion

Changing the hostname on a Debian system is a straightforward process that can be done temporarily or permanently, depending on your needs. Following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can easily update your systemâ€™s hostname to reflect its purpose better, improve network identification, or meet organizational requirements.

Remember:

Always verify the changes using commands like `hostnamectl` or `hostname`.

Ensure the new hostname adheres to standard naming conventions to avoid potential issues.

If your system is part of a network, double-check that the new hostname is unique and does not conflict with other devices.

With these steps, you can confidently manage and customize your Debian systemâ€™s hostname. Whether working on a personal project or managing a server, this skill will help you keep your systems organized and easily identifiable. Happy computing! ðŸš€

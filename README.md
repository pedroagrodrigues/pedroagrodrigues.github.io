# ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!

I am a dedicated System and Network Administrator currently employed at [ARDITI](https://www.arditi.pt/){:target="_blank"} (AgÃªncia Regional para o Desenvolvimento da InvestigaÃ§Ã£o, Tecnologia e InovaÃ§Ã£o). In my current role, I take pride in my responsibilities of deploying and managing a virtualisation environment using Proxmox, alongside handling enterprise networking equipment, including switches and routers.

My academic journey equipped me with a solid foundation. I earned both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Informatics Engineering from the esteemed University of Madeira.  While at the university, I had the privilege of collaborating as a research assistant in the BRaNT project, conducted in partnership with NOVA LINCS/ARDITI. In this project, I tested machine learning tools and techniques, contributing significantly to the creation of cognitive profiles. Additionally, I deployed and managed a server for the project's virtualization environment, using Proxmox to host the necessary servers (VMs).

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong affinity for Python, which is my preferred programming language. However, I have also acquired proficiency in Bash, C, C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.

My expertise includes:
- **Operating Systems** including Linux (Ubuntu, Debian), macOS, and Windows.
- **Web Services and Virtualization:** Experienced in managing web hosting services (LAMP/XAMPP) and virtualization technologies, including Proxmox VE and Docker.
- **Tools and Frameworks** such as Apache, CodeIgniter, Docker, Git, Joomla, Jupyter, Laravel, Nginx, Proxmox VE, and VMWare.
